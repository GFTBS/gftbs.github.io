Absolute error is the difference between the calculated and the actual number. Relative error scales the error based on the size of the two numbers, almost like a percent error. Using a binary computer introduces errors when dealing with decimal values because sometimes there is no direct conversion. There is also the error involved when a number gets so small a that a normal floating point cannot contain it.
