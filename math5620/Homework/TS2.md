# Task Sheet 2:  
#### Task 1: Build a code that will initialize the tridiagonal matrix for the simple elliptic ordinary differential equation in the textbook. Use the array storage version of the matrix storage. Also implement the code that initializes the right hand side vector. Make the code reusable  

Output from TS2Demo

    Tri diagonal Matrix 2, -1, 1 size = 10 (right hand side is contained in the matrix)

    [ 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 ]
    [ -1 2 1 0 0 0 0 ]
    [ 0 -1 2 1 0 0 0 ]
    [ 0 0 -1 2 1 0 0 ]
    [ 0 0 0 -1 2 1 0 ]
    [ 0 0 0 0 -1 2 0 ]

#### Task 2: Implement an algorithm for solving the linear system in the book for the elliptic problem. pg. 15, 16

#### Task 3: Write up the results that you obtain in the approximate solution of the elliptic problem.  

#### Task 4: Write a code that will compute the coefficients for a finite difference approximation of a given derivative. There is a version of the code (in Matlab) that will do the job. If you use Matlab to get this done, expand out all of the shorthand notation that Matblab uses.  

#### Task 5: Write up a software manual page (we will go through a template in class. Put pages in for the codes you have written for this homework assignment.  

#### Task 6: Search the internet for applications that involve modeling real physical processes with a simple elliptic ODE. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describes your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
