#### Task 6: Search for the difference quotient approximations of derivatives  
http://cis.poly.edu/~mleung/CS3734/s03/ch01/derivative1c44.pdf  
The difference quotient is the method computers and calculators use. Most Texas Instruments calculators use the centered difference quotient because it reduces error by allowing for a smaller h. The centered difference quotient is preffered for most applications because of the increased accuracy. There was also a graph showing increasing accuracy as h decreased until h got too small and round off error quickly threw the answer off.
