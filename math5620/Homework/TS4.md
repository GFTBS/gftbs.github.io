### Task 6: Search the internet for discussions of using finite difference methods to handle a nonconstant coefficient function. That is, find sites for elliptic problems of the form
### (k(x) u′)′=f  
https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01662050/document  
This site described the use of nonconstant coefficient functions in things like flow through an area of uneven material. Cell-centered finite-difference discretization of the Laplace was discussed. The use of this method was to obtain more degrees of freedom and drive consistency.
